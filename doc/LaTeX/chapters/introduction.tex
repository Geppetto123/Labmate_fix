\chapter{Introduction}

The whole concept behind this project is to make a robust core base for the LabMate in order to easily implement sensors. The robot 
can be controlled remotely by another computer via \textbf{ssh} and it is also possible to get its position by \textbf{ssh}. So if, for example, 
a future application needed to implement cameras so the robot can deviate obstacles, the only thing that should be managed is the image 
processing for the camera and, based on it, sending twist comands to the robot.

Here, it will be exposed the composition of the LabMate in techinical terms. There will be no explanation whatsoever about how the components work.
