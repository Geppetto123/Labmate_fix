\chapter{The PC}
A PC running on Ubuntu was chosen as a machine-in-the-middle between the Arduinos and the computer connected to it remotely.
\\ \\
These are the funztionalities of the PC onboard:
\begin{itemize}
    \item it sends the position of the robot given by one of the Arduinos via USB when required remotely
    \item it gets a twist command sent remotely and passes it via USB to the Arduino responsible for driving the motors
\end{itemize}
